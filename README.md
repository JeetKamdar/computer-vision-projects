# computer-vision-projects

There are two projects here. 
- Project-1 implements the Canny Edge Detector Algorithm to detect the edges in a given image.
- Project-2 implements the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algoirthm and a Two-Layered Neural Network to detect human faces in a given image. 

Both projects work with ".bmp" image format.


To run the Canny Edge Detector project, use:

   ``` python project1_canny.py “image-path” ```


To run the face detection project, use:

python face_detection.py “Image_directory_location”
